ExtempFiller2 is an automated research assistant.
Given a topic to research, a search engine, and a storage space, ExtempFiller2 automatically finds and downloads related web pages.
Currently ExtempFiller2 can search the web with Google and DuckDuckGo, but the design is modular and may be extended.
Additionally, the program can either save web pages to Evernote (with a developer token) or to the hard drive in either HTML or plaintext. (Again this is extendable)
In order to find relevant information within web pages, ExtempFiller2 makes use of the Readability web service.
